Folder Details
code/: Contains subfolders for each model (ResNet, VGG16, AlexNet, LeNet), with Jupyter notebooks files for training and evaluation.
dataset/: Contains the main dataset with images of fingerprints categorized by blood group types (A+, A-, B+, B-, AB+, AB-, O+, O-).
graphs/: Stores accuracy, validation accuracy, loss, and validation loss graphs for each model.
performance_metrix/: Contains bar graphs comparing the performance metrics across different models.
sample dataset/: Includes a sample fingerprint image to preview the dataset.
test/: Placeholder for any testing or additional data as needed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or later
Jupyter Notebook
PyTorch
Additional libraries listed in requirements.txt
To install required libraries, run:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Cloning the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Fingerprint-Based-Blood-Group-Detection.git
cd Fingerprint-Based-Blood-Group-Detection
Dataset
The dataset contains fingerprint images organized into folders by blood group type. There are approximately 6,000â€“7,000 images spread across the eight blood group categories.

Each subfolder within dataset/datasetbloodgroup/ represents a blood group and contains fingerprint images labeled accordingly.
Ensure that you have sufficient storage space before downloading or expanding the dataset.

Models
This project explores the following CNN architectures:

ResNet
VGG16
AlexNet
LeNet
Each model has a dedicated folder under code/, with:

A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) that contains code for training and testing.
Results
Performance metrics and training graphs are stored in separate folders for easy access and visualization.

graphs/: Includes accuracy, validation accuracy, loss, and validation loss plots for each model, which help visualize the model's performance over time.
performance_metrix/: Contains bar graphs comparing the performance of different models.
Sample Dataset
The sample dataset/ folder includes a sample fingerprint image to give users an idea of the dataset's format.

Usage
Dataset Preparation: Ensure that the dataset/ folder is populated with the required fingerprint images.

Running the Models: Navigate to the respective model folder in code/, open the Jupyter notebook, and run it step-by-step. Each notebook is designed to:

Load the dataset
Train the model on the training dataset
Evaluate the model on the test dataset
Viewing Results: After training, check the graphs/ and performance_metrix/ folders for visualizations of the training process and model comparisons.

Testing on Sample Data: You can test the model using images from the sample dataset/ or by adding additional test images to the test/ folder.
